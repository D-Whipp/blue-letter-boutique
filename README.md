## Purpose

I need to advance my skills with Front End Technologies so I can be a more enticing candidate when potential employers are considering adding a member to their team. I completed the [University of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp](./src/assets/app-screenshot/Full-Stack-Web-Development-University-of-Arizona-Badging.png) and have been completing courses on Udemy/LinkedIn Learning (to keep up my skills) while looking for a job. Blue Letter Boutique, inspired by [Red Dress](https://www.reddress.com/), was built to show off what I've learned so far.

## Usage

[Blue Letter Boutique](https://glittering-brigadeiros-85868e.netlify.app/) (referred to as BLB) is an E-commerce website and behaves as such. Click the link and you'll be taken to BLB's website where you can:

-   1. Create an account
-   2. Sign In if you have an existing account
-   3. Contact Customer support through email
-   4. Reset user password if needed
-   5. Browse multiple categories of clothing
-   6. Add items to a cart
-   7. View the cart
-   8. TEST purchase the cart items using Stripes test card number

### IMPORTANT

I DID NOT setup this website for users to make actual purchases. Parting with money is THE most important interaction a user will have with an E-commerce site. As this is NOT an actual online store I have NOT turned on actual payments. \
If you wish to test the Credit Card component enter in \
4242 4242 4242 4242 for the Card number. \
Set the expiration date to anytime in the FUTURE. \
The CVV and Zip Code can be any number. \

## Technologies

This SPA Application uses:

-   Stripe for payments
-   React for the Front End Library
-   Netlify for deployment
-   Google Firebase for database
-   Google Login for user authentication
-   DotEnv for environment
-   ImageKit.io for my Content Delivery Network
-     - This is where I store all of my images for my database (Google Firebase) to reference
