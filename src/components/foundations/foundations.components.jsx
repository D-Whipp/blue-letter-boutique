                        We at <span>Blue Letter Boutique</span> love
                        fashion and we've experienced tremendous
                        success within this industry. With this
                        success comes a powerful desire to give back
                        to our communities; to show how grateful we
                        are. While we give most of our donations
                        privately we feel compelled to publicly
                        recognize the orginizations we donate to.
